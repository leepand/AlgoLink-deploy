## Developing and running locally

This site is built with [docsify](https://docsify.js.org/#/).

To get started developing locally first install `docsify-cli` globally by running:

```bash
npm i docsify-cli -g
```

Then, clone this repository and then `cd` into the directory.

To start the dev server run:

```bash
docsify start ./docs
```

Now the documentation app will be running at [http://localhost:4000](http://localhost:4000)

```bash
[SSR] Serving ./docs now.
Listening at http://localhost:4000
```

Check [docsify's quick start guide](https://docsify.js.org/#/quickstart) if you have any issues with the development.
